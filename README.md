This code implements the first example of the published paper: 

H Dang-Trung, E Keilegavlen, I Berre. Numerical modeling of wing crack propagation accounting for fracture contact mechanics. International Journal of Solids and Structures 204, 233-247

Main features:

1. Mechanical analysis of fractured elasticity uses the first and second-order finite element method.

2. Implement an adaptive re-meshing process based on the error estimator.

3. Compute the stress intensity factor using Quater point elements.
